# Review Notes - Full Page Review

## Overall Assessment
The page loads and all sections are present. The design is cohesive with the dark midnight blue theme.

## Section-by-Section Review

### Hero Section
- Title "Urban Sanctuary" renders in gold gradient - GOOD
- Catchcopy text visible and readable
- Background image NOT loading - appears as solid dark blue background
- CTA button "キャストを見る" not visible - likely below the catchcopy but might be cut off
- Need to fix: hero background image, ensure CTA button is visible

### Concept Section  
- Left-right layout works well
- Glass panel with concept text looks elegant
- Background image partially visible (concept-bg.jpg) - subtle but present
- Text is readable

### Safety Section
- Three cards with icons (Lock, Eye, Shield) - all visible
- Gold accent text for titles
- Glass panel cards look good
- All text content correct

### Cast Section
- Three cast photos loading correctly! All three images visible
- Names, ages, and specialties shown below photos
- Photos have a slight grayscale effect (hover effect)
- Layout is clean 3-column grid

### Flow Section
- Four steps displayed horizontally
- Icons in circles with gold borders
- Step numbers, titles, subtitles, descriptions all present
- Connecting line visible between steps

### Price Section
- Two pricing cards side by side
- Basic Plan ¥10,000 and Escort Plan ¥20,000
- "Recommended" badge on Escort Plan
- Features listed with bullet points
- Gold gradient on prices

### Footer
- Not fully visible in last scroll but content is there

## Issues to Fix
1. **Hero background image not showing** - The image URL is very long, might be an issue
2. **CTA button might be missing or invisible** in hero section
3. **Header nav scrolled state** - needs glass effect when scrolled (already coded)
4. Need to verify mobile responsiveness
